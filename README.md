# GraphTheoristSketchpad

The program was written in Visual Studio .NET C# to run on the Windows Operating System. The design and ensuing program make maximum use of simple data types. The software was designed to be used in a Graph Theory class. 

Full List of Features

•	Move a vertex (with its edges)
•	Delete a vertex (and all edges connected to it)
•	Delete an edge
•	Draw parallel edges
•	Draw loops (including parallel loops)
•	Select vertex/edge color before drawing
•	Change a vertex/edge color after drawing
•	Undo / Redo actions
Information Display
